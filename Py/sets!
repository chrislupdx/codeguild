set1 = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
list = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

print(list)
print(set(list))
if you ever unique things in an iterator, a set will
dictionary vs a set= a dictionary has colons in them
sets are hashable

list = []
for i in range(1, 11):
  list(appented(i)
print(lst)

list comprehension, python is unique to python:it's a loop inside an interator
lst = [x for x in range(1, 11)]
print(lst)
