# Tricks+conventionsself.
# Constants
# GRAVITY = 9.68 (BC it never changes, but that's just convention, in Js there are declarative that is enforced, where in python they're not)
# exp:
#     GRAVITY = 6.68
#     GRAVITY = 6.69 (in Py, you can change constants, in Js, you can't re-assign stuff based on type?)
# Variables are snake_case_because_of_the_undercores (and remain so)
# CamelCase (there's a Js version of camelCase (firstSecondThird))
#     in Py CamelCase, it is a class
# There are a few others but that's just it for python
#
# numbers are allowed later, (in Js underscore renders stuff private aka cannot be accessed out of themselves)
# Variables cannot begin with symbols or integers (underscore allowed)
#     if you see an underscore at the start of a thing that means you have to be inside to access it (in py this is simply a convention)

a = 1
b = 2
a, b = b, a
print(a)
print(b)
#this above swaps the values, not all programming langauges can do this)

a, b = 1 , 2 (tuple unpacking, you can re-assign stuff positionally) http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/tuples.html
